# Pizza Sales Project (SQL)

## 📖 Project Overview
This project analyzes a **Pizza Sales Dataset** using SQL queries to answer business-related questions ranging from basic to advanced.  
The analysis covers order volume, sales revenue, popular pizza types, customer behavior, and category-wise performance.  
To present the findings, I designed a **visual slide deck in Canva**, showcasing each question with its query and result screenshot.
